- Every storage store data in the form of string

1. Local Storage:-

- Life long storage(permanent)
- Size of data(5mb-10mb).
- Not secure at all.
- What do developer store? State less credentials(access_token).

2. Session Storage:-

- temporary storage(browser/tab close data gone)
- Size of data(5mb-10mb).
- It's vulnerable to (cross-site scripting)/ XSS attacks through JS file.
- What do developer store? Sensitive information store.

3. Cookies:-

- Short Term storage but with expiration duration.
- Size of data 4kb only.
- It is vulnerable to (cross-site scripting)/ XSS attacks through JS file.

Q. Can session storage be used across multiple windows or tabs?
ANS: No, whoever created seeeion forexample, tab or window, only that has access to that session. If I have share across multiple tab/windows, we have to use Local storage.
